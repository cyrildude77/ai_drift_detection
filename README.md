# 🧠 AI-Based Concept Drift Detection Using LSTM Autoencoders

An advanced, real-time AI system designed to detect **concept drift** in streaming data using **LSTM Autoencoders**. This project is built with modularity, scalability, and production-readiness in mind, featuring API deployment, feedback loops, CI/CD, and monitoring.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In real-world systems like fraud detection, cybersecurity, and predictive maintenance, the data distribution often evolves. This leads to **concept drift**, where the model’s original assumptions no longer hold true — causing inaccurate predictions over time.

This project detects such drifts proactively using **deep learning-based sequential modeling**, enabling dynamic model adaptation and reliability.

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load time-series data (batch or streaming).
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize and transform data into sliding windows.
3. **LSTM Autoencoder**: Trained to learn normal patterns.
4. **Drift Detection**: High reconstruction error = possible drift.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Human or auto-confirmation for retraining.
6. **API & Monitoring**: Real-time response with visualization support.
7. **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deploy.
